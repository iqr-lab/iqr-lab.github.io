#  Our Mission

Our research is centered around interactive robot learning. As robots become more commonplace in human environments, they will need to adapt to novel task variations that they have not been trained to address. We develop algorithms that allow a robot to structure and interpret its interactions with a human teacher in order to adapt its task knowledge to novel situations. By enabling a robot to ask for help in addressing unfamiliar problems, our work contributes toward a future of adaptive, collaborative robots.
