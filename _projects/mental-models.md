project-tag: mental-models
description: "In order for robots to be able to assist humans in diagnosing and solving problems in safety-critical situations, they need to be able to actively provide the social signals necessary to present high-dimensional data clearly, challenge a teammateâ€™s beliefs, collaboratively assess ambiguous problems, and design solutions. We are developing Active Learning methods to enable robots to develop shared mental models with its human teammates."
