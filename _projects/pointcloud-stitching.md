title: Pointcloud Stitching
description: "Scalable, multicamera distributed system for realtime pointcloud stitching in IQR Lab. This program is currently designed to use the D400 Series Intel RealSense depth cameras. Using the librealsense 2.0 SDK, depth frames are grabbed and pointclouds are computed on the edge, before sending the raw XYZRGB values to a central computer over a TCP sockets. The central program stitches the pointclouds together and displays it a viewer using PCL libraries."
