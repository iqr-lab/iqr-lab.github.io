I'm a recent graduate with an M.S. in Computer Science from Yale University, joining the Inquisitive Robotics Lab as a research assistant starting 2024 summer. My research interests focus on learning from demonstration and robot planning using Large Language Model (LLMs). I'm particularly focused on how LLMs can enhance a robot's ability to understand and reason. Currently I'm working on "From Demonstration to Parameterize Task Models," which aims to convert demonstrations and natural language instructions into parameterized API calls using LLMs.
Before joining Yale, I received my bachelor's degree from Vanderbilt University, majoring in Computer Science
and Applied Mathematics.
