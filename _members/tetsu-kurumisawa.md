I am a junior in Branford college, majoring in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. At the Inquisitive Robotics Lab, I am working on  "Inferring Human Mental Models for Human Robot Collaboration to Solve Faults," where we are using LLMs to infer human mental models in the form of knowledge graphs. My interests lie in the intersection of HRI and computational psychological modeling. I believe in the importance of creating explainable Artificial Intelligence models especially when recent advancements in the field have been focused on practicality and performance and have essentially been a black box in terms of human cognition modeling.
