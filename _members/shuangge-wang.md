I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Yale University, advised by Brian Scassellati and Tesca Fitzgerald. My research studies human behaviors in a wide variety of human-robot interaction scenarios, such as learning, teaching, and collaboration. Before Yale, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Southern California.
