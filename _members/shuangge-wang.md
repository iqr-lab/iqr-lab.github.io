I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Yale University, advised by Brian Scassellati and Tesca Fitzgerald. My research studies human feedback modeling in robot learning settings. I'm also interested in enabling robots to interpret and adapt to human feedback in diverse HRI scenarios such as learning, teaching, and collaboration. Before Yale, I received my undergraduate degree from the University of Southern California.
