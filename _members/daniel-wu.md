I am a junior in Davenport College studying Computer Science & Economics.
I’m currently working on a code verification system for the Alchemist project to ensure that generated code matches the user’s specifications. I’m interested in discovering if there are formal approaches to this problem, and I want to find a way to integrate such an approach while maintaining Alchemist’s collaborative design paradigm.
