I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student Inquisitive Robotics Lab at Yale University. My research interest lies in Human-Robot Interaction, specifically in Human-Robot Collaboration and Robots learning from humans. I am driven by the pursuit of research that facilitates seamless collaboration between humans and robots by equipping robots with the ability to learn from human interactions and effectively reason about their tasks. While we have made significant advancements in AI systems capable of interpreting and reasoning over human instructions, the challenge lies in seamlessly integrating these capabilities into robotic systems. I firmly believe that a pivotal approach towards achieving this goal is enabling robots to engage in interactive learning from humans, all while possessing the awareness of their own limitations, thus guiding their interactions with humans.
