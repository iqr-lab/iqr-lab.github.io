I am a first-year master’s student in Computer Science at Yale University. My research focuses on interactive robot learning, particularly in enabling robots to learn from human feedback and reason over human intentions. I am also broadly interested in utilizing large multimodal models to enhance robotic systems.
Prior to joining Yale, I received my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University.
