Hi! I'm Anushka, and I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Yale University in the Inquisitive Robotics Lab, advised by Tesca Fitzgerald. My research vision is driven by my goal to contribute to enabling astronauts to explore deep space. Enabling astronauts to explore deep space requires astronauts to be able to solve complex problems without relying on experts on Earth due to space/ground communication delays and/or lack of communication. My research goal is to draw from established collaboration strategies humans use to solve problems in safety-critical situations to develop agents that can collaborate with astronauts to solve emergency anomalies.
