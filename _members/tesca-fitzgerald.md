I am an Assistant Professor in Yaleâ€™s Computer Science department.

My research is centered around interactive robot learning. As robots become more commonplace in human environments, they will need to adapt to novel task variations that they have not been trained to address. I develop algorithms that allow a robot to structure and interpret its interactions with a human teacher in order to adapt its task knowledge to novel situations. By enabling a robot to ask for help in addressing unfamiliar problems, my work contributes toward a future of adaptive, collaborative robots.

Before joining Yale, I was a postdoc at CMU with Henny Admoni, Reid Simmons, and Aaron Steinfeld. I completed my PhD at Georgia Tech in 2020, advised by Ashok Goel and Andrea Thomaz. My dissertation research focused on using human interaction to enable a robot to transfer task models to new environments.
