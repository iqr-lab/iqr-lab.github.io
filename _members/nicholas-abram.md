I'm Nicholas, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Howard University and a member of the Karsh STEM Scholars Program.
My research interests lie in ubiquitous computing with large language models (LLMs) and AI methodologies in general. I am 
fascinated by the potential of Artificial Intelligence to mimic the world. I believe we are in a great time of advancement, 
and I want to be a part of it.
