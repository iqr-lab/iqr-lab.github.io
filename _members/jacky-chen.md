I am a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science. I'm currently working on my senior project titled "SMART: Shaping Modalities within Active Learning through Robot Transparency", which looks into the impact of transparency on human feedback within different modalities.
Outside of research, I enjoy running, weightlifting, and exploring the outdoors!
